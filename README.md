# Custom Image Loading Library

This project is a custom Android image loading library that demonstrates lazy loading, disk and memory caching, and efficient image pre-fetching using Retrofit for network requests. It includes a 3-column grid layout with smooth scrolling and optimized performance for handling large numbers of images. The images used in this project are fetched using Pexels API.

## Features
- **Lazy Loading:** Images are loaded lazily, ensuring that only the visible images are fetched and displayed. As you scroll, images that are out of view are unloaded, and new images are fetched as needed.
- **Disk Caching:** Images are cached on disk to reduce network requests and improve loading times. This ensures that previously loaded images are quickly available when revisited.
- **Memory Caching:** Recently loaded images are stored in memory for immediate access, further improving performance.
- **Paging:** Efficient paging mechanism to load a large set of images in chunks, with pre-fetching of the next set of images to avoid jitter during scrolling.
- **3-Column Grid Layout:** The RecyclerView is set up with a 3-column grid layout for displaying images in an organized manner.
## Architecture
- **Retrofit:** Used for making network requests to fetch image data from the Pexels API.
- **OkHttp:** Handles disk caching for network responses.
- **LruCache:** Manages memory caching of images.
- **Paging:** Uses Androidâ€™s Paging library for efficient loading of large data sets.
